# NAME

bear - build ear

# SYNOPSIS

bear [*options*] -- [*build commands*]

# DESCRIPTION

Bear is a tool to generate compilation database for clang tooling.

The [JSON compilation database][1] is used in clang project to provide
information how a single compilation unit was processed. When that
is available then it is easy to re-run the compilation with different
programs.

Bear execs the original build command and intercept the `exec` calls.
To achive that Bear uses the `LD_PRELOAD` or `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`
mechanisms provided by the dynamic linker. There is a library which
defines the `exec` methods and used in every child processes of the
build command. The executable itself sets the environment up to child
processes and writes the output file.

# OPTIONS

-o *output*
:   Specify output file. Default value provided.
    (This option mainly for development purposes.)

-b *library*
:   Specify the preloaded library location. Default value provided.
    (This option mainly for development purposes.)

-s *socket*
:   Specify UNIX socket file. Default value provided.
    (This option mainly for development purposes.)

-d
:   Generate debug output. Debug output is also a *JSON* formated file.
    It contains all available informations of the `exec` calls.
    (This option for those who want to extend functionality of bear.)

-c
:   Print out known compilers, which are used at the post-processing
    step.

-e
:   Print out known source file extensions, which are used at the
    post-processing step.

# OUTPUT

There are two version of output formats. One is defined by the clang
tooling. This goes like this:

    [
      { "directory": "/home/user/llvm/build",
        "command": "clang++ -Irelative -c -o file.o file.cc",
        "file": "file.cc" },
      ...
    ]

To achive this bear has to run some filtering and formating. One task
is to find out about compiler invocation. Build tool execs many command
during the build process. This is done by filtering out the executable
name. Bear has a built in list of known compiler names. Second task is
to find the source file name from the list of arguments. This is dones
by looking for the arguemnts and check whether it has extension, and
the extension is for a source file. Again, bear has a built in list of
known source file extensions. Both built-in lists can be viewed but not
modified.

Since the post process might be buggy, there is a way to see all exec
calls. This gives opportunity to write custom post processing. The format
of the debug output looks like this:

    [
      { "pid": "1234",
        "ppid": "100",
        "function": "execve",
        "directory": "/home/user/llvm/build",
        "command": "clang++ -Irelative -c -o file.o file.cc" },
      ...
    ]

Both output is JSON format, which means that *command* field is escaped
if one of the argument had space, slash or quote character. All the other
fields are as it was captured.

# BUGS

Compiler wrappers like [ccache][2] and [distcc][3] could cause duplicates
or missing items in the compilation database. Make sure you have been disabled
before you run Bear.
